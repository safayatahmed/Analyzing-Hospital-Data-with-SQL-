# Analyzing-Hospital-Data-with-SQL-
Analyze hospital patient encounters, costs, and behavior trends

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?
### I am genuinely interested in hospital analytics, particularly in understanding how hospitals compete and operate within a complex healthcare landscape that includes smaller clinics and local practitioners. Through this project, I aim to grasp the intricacies of hospital operations and learn how to analyze overall business performance when the patient is the central focus. 

This endeavor is a key component of my SQL Mastery course with Interactive Cares, where I've been given the opportunity to decompose raw healthcare data into meaningful insights. My primary goal is to uncover insights that can help healthcare providers better understand their patient demographics, treatment patterns, and operational efficiencies, ultimately enhancing patient care and optimizing resource allocation

## The Dataset
### This hospital analytics dataset provides a comprehensive view of patient journeys and healthcare operations. It comprises four key components: Patients, detailing demographics and personal information; Encounters, capturing details of each patient visit, including costs and associated organizations/payers; Payers, outlining information about the insurance providers; and Procedures, recording the medical procedures performed during each encounter. This interconnected dataset is designed to facilitate insights into patient care, operational efficiency, and financial aspects within a hospital setting.
